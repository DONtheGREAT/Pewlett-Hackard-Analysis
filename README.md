### Pewlett Hackard
### Module 7 Analysis

## __Overview of Analysis__

The purpose of this analysis was to assist Pewlett Hackard in quantifying the amount and specific details of employees that will be retiring soon. This is
something important for them to anticipate as they will have to decide which positions will require the most job postings. There will also be a mentorship program for
internal transitions into positions that will be becoming available. Employees that will participate in this program must meet a certain criteria, and they will need data
displaying those  that are eligible.

The snippet displays a count of all the titles that will be retiring within the company. With this count Hewlett Packard can get an exact count of how many positions
they will need in the near future to make sure that workloads can stay spread even and low manpower does not effect productivity. The analysis shows that a lot 
of their senior positions will be retiring soon. This can be great for the mentorship program, it can give their entry and mid level staff and engineers an opportunity to
mentor under some of the most experienced employees in the company and be equipped to fill their roles once they retire. An are that may not be as urgent to find replacements is in management as they project that only 2 managers will be retiring. This gives them more time to ensure they can find the right candidates for the position.
